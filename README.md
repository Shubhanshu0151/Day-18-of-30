# Day 18 of 30
### Today, I focused on refining the Catalog model and fixing the AppBar in my Flutter application. Enhancing the Catalog model involved ensuring accurate data representation and seamless integration with the UI components. Addressing the AppBar issues, I customized and fixed the layout to provide a consistent and visually appealing navigation experience across the app. These improvements are essential for creating a polished and user-friendly application, ensuring both functionality and aesthetics are up to standard.

Stay tuned for more updates on my journey! ðŸš€ðŸ“±
